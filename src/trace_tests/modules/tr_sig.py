"""TR-SIG: Signature verification (spec §3.2.1).

Records are verified over their RFC 8785 (JCS) canonical bytes, excluding the
``signature`` field, with the key in ``trace.cnf.jwk``.

RFC 8785 and not an ad-hoc serializer, because §3.2.2 of the specification says so
in as many words: "Implementations MUST use an RFC 8785-conformant library. Using
``json.dumps(sort_keys=True)`` (Python) or equivalent ad-hoc sorting is
insufficient." This module used ``json.dumps(sort_keys=True, separators=(",", ":"),
ensure_ascii=True)`` until it was pointed at trace-spec's canonicalization corpus,
which rejected all four of its valid, correctly signed records. The two forms agree
on every ASCII record, which is every record this suite carried, so nothing here
failed while the suite told conformant implementations they were not.

A plain trace record carrying a ``signature`` field is verified against it. One
without a signature cannot be, so TR-SIG fails closed: at any level that requires
signatures (level >= 1) the result is FAIL; at level 0 it is an explicit UNVERIFIED
finding, so a record with nothing to check is never reported as verified.
