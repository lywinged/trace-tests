"""TR-APR: Evidence appraisal checks (spec §3.1).

Well-formedness only. TR-APR never resolves anything: it performs no network
access, no filesystem access, and takes no resolver. `appraisal.policy_ref`
names the appraisal policy and this module checks the *shape* of that name;
resolving the enforced bundle at `policy.policy_uri` against
`policy.bundle_hash` is TR-POL-003's business. Two fields, two objects, no
overlapping assertion.

Every code here emits PASS, FAIL or SKIP and never UNVERIFIED, so none of them
appears in `unverified.UNVERIFIED_FAILS_FROM_LEVEL`. That absence is a decision
rather than an oversight: UNVERIFIED means a check could not be executed
against the evidence the record cites, and nothing here has a referent to lose.
With no resolver and no remote object, every predicate is a total function of
the record, the level and the clock.
