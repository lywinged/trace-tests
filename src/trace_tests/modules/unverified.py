"""Which unverified findings fail a run, and from which conformance level.

An unverified finding means the check could not be executed against the
evidence the record cites. That is a statement about reachability, not about
the record being wrong: the evidence may be perfectly good and simply out of
reach. It is held apart from a skip so that a consumer can never read it as a
benign omission.

Whether such a finding fails the run is **per code**, read from the table
below, rather than one rule applied to every unverified finding at once.
Different checks lose their evidence for different reasons and at different
levels. A record with no signature cannot be called conformant anywhere that
requires one. A policy bundle that did not resolve is a weaker statement, and
the level at which it stops being tolerable is a property of that check rather
than of the status.

A code absent from the table fails from level 1, which is what the blanket
rule did for every code before this table existed. That default is deliberate:
a new code that nobody remembered to register still fails closed, and the
registration guard turns red rather than the run turning quietly permissive.
