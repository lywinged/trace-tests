"""The published error codes and record samples must agree with the modules.

Every check here comes from drift that was live in `main`, not from first principles.
`TR-SIG-005` was carried by every signature finding and documented nowhere. `TR-ANC-002`
was documented in three files and named by no module, with two descriptions that
disagreed. `docs/levels.md` showed an `anchor` object the closed schema does not define,
and a `runtime.platform` of `sev-snp`, which is not in the enum.

Documentation that disagrees with the code is worse than absent documentation: it reads
as verified. Nothing checked it, which is why all of it survived.
