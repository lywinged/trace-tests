"""Every hand-written copy of a schema enum, compared against the schema.

A set literal restating a schema enum accepts what it always accepted. The
specification moving is exactly the case it cannot see, and the failure is
silent: the copy keeps passing its own tests while rejecting a value the schema
now permits. Both drifts these tests were written for had that shape.

`measurement/scripts/enum_drift.py` finds these by walking the AST, which is the
right tool for discovering an unknown copy. This file is the other half: the
copies that are already known, asserted on every run, so the next drift fails in
CI rather than waiting to be looked for.
