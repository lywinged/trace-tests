"""A finding's message must not name an error code other than its own.

`report.py` publishes both: the JSON artifact carries `code` per finding and the HTML
table prints it beside the text. When they disagree, the reader has two codes for one
result and no way to tell which the tooling meant.

They did disagree. `_verify_ed25519` returned messages prefixed with `TR-SIG-001`,
`TR-SIG-002` and `TR-SIG-003`, and two callers attached those messages to findings of
their own: `check` under `TR-SIG-005` and `check_cmcp_runtime` under `TR-SIG-001`. A
record with a malformed signature was published as a TR-SIG-005 finding reading
"TR-SIG-003: invalid base64url signature", so the forwarded report named a code the
suite had not used and the docs describe as something else.

Naming a module's own code in its message is the convention everywhere else here and
is left alone; this only rejects naming a different one.
