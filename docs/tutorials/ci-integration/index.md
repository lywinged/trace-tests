# Running trace-tests in a CI Pipeline

Configure a GitHub Actions workflow that installs `agentrust-trace-tests`, runs the full conformance suite, and uploads the test report as an artifact.

## What you'll learn

- A working GitHub Actions workflow file with matrix Python version testing
- How to use `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1` to run the software-only TEE path in standard CI
- How to read a failure back to the specific error code and field it names
- When to skip hardware attestation tests that require real TEE hardware

## Prerequisites

```
pip install agentrust-trace-tests pytest pytest-json-report
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Write the workflow

Create `.github/workflows/trace-tests.yml` in your repository:

```
name: TRACE conformance

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  conformance:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install agentrust-trace-tests pytest pytest-json-report

      - name: Run conformance suite
        env:
          CMCP_DEV_MODE: "1"
        run: |
          pytest --tb=short \
                 --json-report \
                 --json-report-file=report-${{ matrix.python-version }}.json

      - name: Upload test report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: trace-report-py${{ matrix.python-version }}
          path: report-${{ matrix.python-version }}.json
```

The `fail-fast: false` setting lets all Python versions finish even if one matrix leg fails, so you can see whether a failure is version-specific.

______________________________________________________________________

## Set CMCP_DEV_MODE for software-only CI

Standard CI runners have no TEE hardware. Set `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1` to allow records with `runtime.platform: "software-only"` to pass TR-RTE without a real attestation measurement.

```
- name: Run conformance suite
  env:
    CMCP_DEV_MODE: "1"
  run: pytest --tb=short
```

When this environment variable is absent, TR-RTE checks that `runtime.platform` is a registered hardware TEE enum (`intel-tdx`, `amd-sev-snp`, `nvidia-h100`, etc.). With `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1`, the `software-only` platform value passes. Never set this flag in production verification.

______________________________________________________________________

## Skip hardware attestation tests

Some tests require a live TEE to produce a real attestation report. Mark them so they skip automatically on standard runners:

```
import os
import pytest

HW_AVAILABLE = os.getenv("TEE_HARDWARE") == "1"

@pytest.mark.skipif(not HW_AVAILABLE, reason="requires real TEE hardware")
def test_amd_sev_snp_measurement_round_trip():
    ...
```

In your workflow, standard jobs skip these tests silently. A separate job on hardware-provisioned runners can set `TEE_HARDWARE=1` to run the full set.

You can also use pytest markers to exclude the hardware group entirely in CI:

```
pytest -m "not hardware" --tb=short
```

Register the marker in `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` to avoid the `PytestUnknownMarkWarning`:

```
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
markers = [
    "hardware: tests that require a physical TEE (deselect with -m 'not hardware')",
    "level0: Level 0 conformance tests",
    "level1: Level 1 conformance tests",
    "level2: Level 2 conformance tests",
]
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Read a failure back to its field

When a test fails, `--tb=short` shows the assertion message, which includes the error code:

```
FAILED tests/test_level0.py::TestLevel0Conformance::test_policy_enforcement_mode_known
AssertionError: assert 'strict' in {'advisory', 'enforce', 'silent'}
```

Match the test name to the module (`tr_pol`) and look up the code in the [Error Codes](https://tests.agentrust-io.com/docs/error-codes/index.md) table. For failures surfaced by `runner.run()`, the `Finding` object carries the code directly:

```
from trace_tests.runner import run
from trace_tests.loader import load_record

record, fmt = load_record("trust-record.json")
results = run(record, fmt, level=1)

for module_id, findings in results.items():
    for f in findings:
        if f.failed():
            print(f"{f.code}  {f.message}")
```

Output:

```
TR-RTE-001  TR-RTE-001: runtime.platform must be a recognised TEE enum value, got 'custom-tee'
```

The code `TR-RTE-001` maps to `runtime.platform`. Fix the field in your record and re-run.

______________________________________________________________________

## Upload the test report as an artifact

`pytest-json-report` writes a machine-readable JSON file. The `upload-artifact` step makes it available in the GitHub Actions UI under the run summary.

```
- name: Upload test report
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: trace-report-py${{ matrix.python-version }}
    path: report-${{ matrix.python-version }}.json
```

`if: always()` uploads the report even when the test step fails, so you can inspect failures without re-running.

To produce a JUnit XML report instead (for GitHub's built-in test summary):

```
pytest --tb=short --junit-xml=results.xml
```

```
- name: Publish test results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  if: always()
  with:
    name: junit-results
    path: results.xml
```

______________________________________________________________________

## Matrix testing across Python versions

The `strategy.matrix` block runs the full suite on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12 in parallel. Each leg uploads its own artifact so version-specific regressions are visible without comparing logs manually.

To add a new version, append it to the list:

```
matrix:
  python-version: ["3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "3.13"]
```

If a module uses a stdlib API that changed between versions, the matrix will catch it. The `trace_tests` library targets the same version range, so failures here indicate a compatibility problem in your custom tests or fixtures, not in the library itself.

______________________________________________________________________

## Summary

You have a GitHub Actions workflow that installs `agentrust-trace-tests`, runs the suite across three Python versions with `CMCP_DEV_MODE=1`, and saves per-version JSON reports as artifacts. Hardware attestation tests are marked and skipped on standard runners. When a test fails, the error code in the assertion message maps directly to the spec field that failed.

For more on what each error code means, see [Error Codes](https://tests.agentrust-io.com/docs/error-codes/index.md). To write custom tests against specific modules, see [Writing Conformance Tests](https://tests.agentrust-io.com/docs/tutorials/writing-conformance-tests/index.md).
