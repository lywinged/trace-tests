# Conformance Levels

TRACE defines three conformance levels. Higher levels require all lower-level modules plus additional ones.

| Level | Required Modules | Use Case |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| **0** | TR-ENV, TR-SIG, TR-POL, TR-APR | Software-only development and staging |
| **1** | Level 0 + TR-RTE, TR-SCA | Production TEE-attested records |
| **2** | Level 1 + TR-TXN, TR-ANC | Full records with transparency anchoring |

## Level 0 — Software-only

Level 0 records are signed with a software key. The `runtime.platform` must be `"software-only"`. All-zero measurement is conventional for development use. The `appraisal` block must be present and well-formed — a recognised `status`, a `verifier` that is an absolute URI — but Level 0 does not require the appraisal to affirm.

**Minimum conformant Level 0 record:**

```json
{
  "eat_profile": "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2",
  "iat": 1750000000,
  "subject": "spiffe://trust.example.org/agent/my-agent",
  "model": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "version": "20251001"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "platform": "software-only",
    "measurement": "sha256:0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
  },
  "policy": {
    "bundle_hash": "sha256:b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3",

  },
  "data_class": "internal",

    }
  },
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9..."
}
```

**Modules tested:** TR-ENV, TR-SIG, TR-POL

**What causes a Level 0 failure:**

- `eat_profile` missing or wrong value — TR-ENV-001
- `runtime.platform` is a TEE value (e.g. `amd-sev-snp`) but Level 0 is requested — TR-RTE-001 does not apply, but TR-ENV still checks the envelope
- `policy.enforcement_mode` is `"strict"` or `"monitor"` — TR-POL-002
- `cnf.jwk` missing, of an unsupported key type, or carrying private key material (`d`) — TR-SIG-004
- Signature does not verify against `cnf.jwk` — TR-SIG-005
- `policy.policy_uri` is not an absolute URI, or the bundle it resolves to does not have the digest `policy.bundle_hash` declares — TR-POL-003. The malformed case is reported with or without a resolver: a reference the record got wrong needs no network to detect

- `appraisal` is absent or not an object, or `appraisal.status` is not one of the four values the schema enumerates — TR-APR-001
- `appraisal.verifier` is absent or is not an absolute URI — TR-APR-002
- `appraisal.policy_ref` or `appraisal.timestamp` is present and malformed — TR-APR-003, TR-APR-004. Absent, either one is skipped rather than passed

---

## Level 1 — TEE Attestation

Level 1 adds hardware attestation. `runtime.platform` must be a value from the `runtime.platform` enum in `schemas/trace-claim.json` other than `software-only`, which carries no hardware attestation evidence. The measurement must be non-zero. `appraisal.status` must be `"affirming"` — TR-APR-005.

**Minimum conformant Level 1 record** (changes from Level 0 in bold context):

```json
{
  "eat_profile": "tag:agentrust-io.com,2026:trace-v0.2",
  "iat": 1750000000,
  "subject": "spiffe://trust.example.org/agent/my-agent",
  "model": {
    "provider": "anthropic",
    "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "version": "20251001"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "platform": "amd-sev-snp",
    "measurement": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2"
  },
  "policy": {
    "bundle_hash": "sha256:b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3",
    "enforcement_mode": "enforce"
  },
  "data_class": "confidential",
  "build_provenance": {
    "slsa_level": 2,
    "digest": "sha256:e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4e5f6"
  },
  "appraisal": {
    "status": "affirming",
    "verifier": "https://verifier.agentrust-io.com"
  },
  "transparency": "https://registry.agentrust-io.com/claim/placeholder",
  "cnf": {
    "jwk": {
      "kty": "OKP",
      "crv": "Ed25519",
      "x": "11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo"
    }
  },
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9..."
}
```

**Modules tested:** TR-ENV, TR-SIG, TR-POL, TR-RTE, TR-SCA

**What causes a Level 1 failure over Level 0:**

- `runtime.platform` is `"software-only"` — TR-RTE-001
- `runtime.measurement` is all zeros — TR-RTE-002 (all-zero is invalid at Level 1)
- `build_provenance` missing entirely — TR-SCA-001, TR-SCA-002
- `appraisal.status` is `"none"` — while not a hard schema violation, a conformant Level 1 record should carry `"affirming"`; TR-APR-005 reports this from Level 1 and skips it at Level 0

---

## Level 2 — Transparency Anchoring

Level 2 adds tool transcript and transparency anchor requirements. The `transparency` field must be an HTTPS URI with a host, pointing to a SCITT receipt. The suite checks that it parses and that the scheme and host are present; it does not resolve the URI, and it does not recognise a placeholder value.

**Minimum conformant Level 2 record** (additional fields over Level 1):

```json
{
  "tool_transcript": {
    "hash": "sha256:c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2c3d4",
    "call_count": 4
  },
  "transparency": "https://registry.agentrust-io.com/claim/01J3XKWP4NQZ8R5HT6YD7VMBCE"
}
```

**Modules tested:** TR-ENV, TR-SIG, TR-POL, TR-RTE, TR-SCA, TR-TXN, TR-ANC

**What causes a Level 2 failure over Level 1:**

- `tool_transcript.hash` missing or not a valid `sha256:` digest — TR-TXN-001
- `tool_transcript.call_count` negative or not an integer — TR-TXN-002
- `transparency` is absent or empty, is not a string, or is not an `https://` URI with a host — TR-ANC-001
- no anchor receipt was supplied, the receipt is malformed, or its inclusion proof does not reproduce the committed `merkle_root` — TR-ANC-002. A record cannot reach Level 2 on a URI alone: pass the receipt with `--receipt`
- `policy.policy_uri` is present, a resolver was supplied with `--policy-dir`, and the bundle could not be read — TR-POL-003. Unverified rather than failed, and unverified fails the run from Level 2

---

## Unverified findings

An unverified finding means **the check could not be executed against the
evidence the record cites**. It is held apart from a skip so that a consumer can
never read it as a benign omission, and it is not a pass.

Whether it fails the run is per code rather than one rule over all of them.
Different checks lose their evidence for different reasons, and the level at
which that stops being tolerable is a property of the check.

| Code | UNVERIFIED fails the run from level |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| TR-SIG-005 | 1 |
| TR-POL-003 | 2 |

A code absent from this table fails from Level 1. That default is deliberate: a
new code nobody registered still fails closed, and the registration guard turns
red rather than the run turning quietly permissive. The table is
`UNVERIFIED_FAILS_FROM_LEVEL` in `src/trace_tests/modules/unverified.py`, and
`tests/test_docs_match_the_modules.py` fails if the two disagree.

---

## Choosing a level

- Use **Level 0** during development. Records can use `runtime.platform: "software-only"` and `build_provenance.slsa_level: 0`.
- Use **Level 1** for production deployments in a TEE (AMD SEV-SNP, Intel TDX, NVIDIA H100).
- Use **Level 2** when you need an auditable, tamper-evident log with a SCITT transparency service.

The certification program (launching 2027) will require Level 1 at minimum.
