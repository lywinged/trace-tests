# Does `trace-tests` notice when its own conformance checks break?

**Measured** 2026-08-07 against `agentrust-io/trace-tests` @ `7fc189c` (release 0.4.1),
with the normative schema from `agentrust-io/trace-spec` @ `dc7491c`.

`trace-tests` is the suite an implementer runs to establish that their TRACE
implementation conforms. Its output is a conformance claim. That makes a question one
level up worth asking, and as far as the repository shows, unasked so far:

> If a check inside a conformance module silently stopped working, would the
> repository's own test suite catch it?

For most checks, yes. For ten of the thirty-three failure paths, no.

## Result

```
modules   7        src/trace_tests/modules/tr_*.py
checks    18       distinct TR-xxx-nnn codes
sites     33       Finding(..., Status.FAIL, ...) constructions

by check   15 of 18 verified,  3 unverified
by site    23 of 33 verified, 10 unverified

site margin distribution   0→10   1→12   2→6   3→1   4→3   5→1
```

**Counting by check understates it by more than threefold.** A check code emitted from
three places can have one failure path nothing verifies while the other two are covered,
and it still counts as verified. The sites are where the checks actually live.

### The three checks nothing verifies at all

| Check | What it enforces | Sites |
|---|---|---|
| `TR-SIG-002` | `cnf.jwk` is an OKP/Ed25519 key and carries `x` | 2 of 2 unverified |
| `TR-TXN-001` | `tool_transcript` is present at Level 2, is an object, and its hash is a well-formed digest | 3 of 3 unverified |
| `TR-TXN-002` | `tool_transcript.call_count` is a non-negative integer | 1 of 1 unverified |

Rewriting any of these so it can never fail leaves the suite green.

`TR-TXN-001` carries the most weight. It is the Level 2 requirement that a tool
transcript exist at all. If it regressed, implementations would continue to be stamped
Level 2 conformant without that property being checked — and the transcript is the claim
Level 2 is largely about.

`TR-SIG-002` is the gate that rejects a key that is not Ed25519. With it inert, a record
carrying another key type reaches signature verification rather than being refused at the
key-type check.

### Seven further failure paths inside otherwise-verified checks

`TR-ANC-001`, `TR-SCA-001`, `TR-SIG-004` and `TR-SIG-005` each have at least one site at
margin 0 while other sites of the same code are verified. Those are the paths a
by-code count cannot see.

### Margin is thin where it exists

Twelve sites are held by exactly one test. That is the same no-margin property reported
for the `trace-spec` fixture set in agentrust-io/trace-spec#124, in the repository whose
output is the conformance stamp rather than in the informative fixture set.

## A separate finding: a hand-written enum has drifted

`tests/test_level0.py:7` defines `VALID_PLATFORMS` as a set literal restating the schema's
`runtime.platform` enum. It holds nine values; the schema holds ten. `software-only` is
missing.

The conformance module is correct — `tr_rte.py:_VALID_PLATFORMS` has all ten — so this is
a defect in the self-test, not in what implementers run. Three-way comparison on a Level 0
record carrying `software-only`:

```
tr_rte.check(record, level=0)   PASS      (what an implementer runs)
normative schema                accepts
tests/test_level0.py            FAIL      (contradicts both)
```

It is latent: no vector in `tests/vectors/` uses `software-only`, so nothing triggers it
today. It becomes active the moment one does — and it would then reject behaviour the
project deliberately added, in PR #16/#17, which updated the conformance module and added
`tests/test_software_only_platform.py` while leaving this copy behind.

---

## Method

For every `Finding(..., Status.FAIL, ...)` construction in the conformance modules, rewrite
that site so the check can never fail, run the entire suite, count how many tests notice,
restore. The count is the margin. Zero means the check's failure path is unverified.

### The cheap version gives the wrong answer

The obvious first approach is to grep the test files for `TR-xxx-nnn` codes and diff
against what the modules emit. On this tree it reports **12 unverified checks**. Mutation
reports **3**.

The proxy is wrong because tests exercise a module through `tr_xxx.check(...)` and assert
on the returned findings without naming the codes. Naming is a convention; changing outcome
is the property. The two are not related closely enough to substitute one for the other.

### Guards, each of which produced a wrong answer during development

- **A green baseline is a precondition.** Mutating an already-red suite attributes nothing.
  The script runs the baseline first and aborts if it is not green.
- **A mutation that did not apply is indistinguishable from a check nothing notices.** Each
  rewrite is verified to have changed the file before the suite runs. An earlier hand-run
  of this measurement replaced a string that did not occur in the target, left the suite
  green, and would have been recorded as evidence for the opposite of the truth.
- **An empty site list would report perfect coverage.** Zero sites is a hard stop.
- **Restoration is verified**, not assumed, after every site.
- **An empty path is rejected before it can look valid.** `Path("")` is `.`, which is a
  directory, so the obvious existence check passes and the script measures whichever tree
  it happens to be standing in. The enum comparison had exactly this hole and reported
  success having compared nothing — the failure it exists to find, in itself. It now
  refuses an empty argument, and refuses to report agreement when zero comparisons were
  made.

---

## What this does not establish

- **Not that implementations can skip these checks.** The measurement is about whether a
  regression *in the conformance module* would be caught by `trace-tests`' own suite. An
  implementation still faces whatever the module does today.
- **Not that the unverified checks are wrong.** They may be perfectly correct. They are
  unguarded, which is a statement about the suite, not about them.
- **Only `Status.FAIL` sites were mutated.** `PASS` and `SKIP` paths were not, so a check
  could pass for the wrong reason in a way this does not see.
- **The margin is a count of failing tests, not of independent tests.** Five tests that
  fail together because they share a fixture are one test for this purpose, and this
  measurement does not distinguish that.
- **Nothing here was reported upstream at the time of writing**, and nothing in
  `trace-tests` was modified. The checkout was restored and re-verified green after every
  mutation.

## Reproducing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]" && pytest -q          # expect 118 passed, 5 xpassed

python measurement/scripts/mutate_modules.py  # exits 1 if any check is unguarded
python measurement/scripts/enum_drift.py      # exits 1 on any drifted enum
```

Both default to the checkout they live in, derived from the script's own location rather
than the working directory, and accept an explicit path as `argv[1]`. Both exit non-zero
rather than reporting success over a corpus they could not find.
