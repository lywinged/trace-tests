> **Test suite v0.2.** Tracks [TRACE Spec v0.2](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec).

Conformance tests for TRACE (Trust Runtime Attestation and Compliance Evidence). Run this suite against your implementation to verify it meets the spec before claiming TRACE compliance.

Seven test modules covering the full specification: envelope structure, signature algorithms, TEE runtime claims, policy binding, tool-call transcripts, SCITT transparency anchoring, and supply chain provenance.

## Quick start

```bash
pip install agentrust-trace-tests
trace-tests verify --record path/to/trust-record.jwt --level 1 \
  --expected-nonce "$VERIFIER_CHALLENGE"
```

## A report you can hand to someone else

`verify` answers a question for the person running it. `report` produces an artifact for
somebody who was not there: an auditor, a counterparty, an acquirer.

```bash
trace-tests report --record trust-record.json   --html report.html --json report.json --badge trace.svg
```

It runs **every** level up to `--max-level` rather than one, because the useful answer for
a reader is the highest level the record reaches, not whether it cleared the level someone
happened to pick. The HTML is self-contained: no scripts, no fonts, no external CSS, no
badge service, nothing fetched at open time.

Use `--fail-under 1` to gate CI on a level. Without it the command always exits `0`, which
is what you want when you are producing an artifact rather than enforcing a threshold.

**The report is not evidence, and it says so on its face.** It is unsigned HTML describing
one run of one suite version, and anybody can edit it. So it carries the record's digest,
the suite and library versions, and the exact command to reproduce the result. A reader who
does not trust the sender is told, in the artifact, to go check the record instead. A
conformance report that looks authoritative and cannot be checked is the same shape of
thing as a control plane writing its own log.

`report.json` is stable under `schema: agentrust-io/trace-tests/report/1` for dashboards
and CI.
