# Known Limitations

What this suite does **not** establish. A conformance report is only useful if the reader knows
what it was never checking, so this is the companion to the report rather than a footnote to it.

## What a pass means

**A pass describes the record, not the agent.**
Conformance means the record is well formed, internally consistent, and carries what its level
requires. It says nothing about whether the agent behaved well, whether the policy it ran under
was a sensible policy, or whether the run should have been allowed. A record of a bad run passes
exactly as cleanly as a record of a good one.

**The suite is one implementation, not the definition.**
[trace-spec](https://github.com/agentrust-io/trace-spec) is normative. Where this suite and the
specification disagree, the specification is what other implementations were written against and
the disagreement is a bug worth reporting here.

## Where the checks stop

**`TR-RTE` checks the shape of the attestation fields, not the attestation.**
It validates that `runtime.platform` is a recognised value, that `runtime.measurement` is a well
formed digest, and that the RIM URI parses. It does not obtain a quote, and it does not verify one
against AMD, Intel or a TPM manufacturer root. A record can satisfy `TR-RTE` at Level 1 carrying a
syntactically perfect measurement that no hardware ever produced. Verifying the quote against the
silicon vendor is the relying party's job, and `cmcp_verify` is where that happens.

**`TR-ANC-002` proves inclusion relative to the receipt you hand it.**
It replays the audit path against the Merkle root carried in that receipt. It does not fetch the
`transparency` URI, and it does not establish that the root is one a public log actually
published. A self-consistent receipt over a tree the submitter built themselves will pass. What
the check rules out is a record that has been modified since anchoring, or that was never in the
tree the receipt commits to. Establishing that the tree is real is a separate step and is not in
scope here.

`TR-ANC-001` is explicit that it checks the pointer rather than the anchor. Supplying no receipt
fails `TR-ANC-002`, so Level 2 cannot be reached on a well formed URI alone.

## Statuses that are easy to misread

**`UNVERIFIED` is about reachability, not correctness.**
It means the check could not be run against the evidence the record cites. The evidence may be
perfectly good and simply out of reach. It is deliberately held apart from a skip so that it can
never be read as a benign omission.

Whether an unverified finding fails a run is decided per code, in
`src/trace_tests/modules/unverified.py`, not by one blanket rule. `TR-POL-003` is tolerated until
Level 2; anything the table does not name fails from Level 1, so a newly added code fails closed
rather than turning a run quietly permissive.

**A `TR-ENV` profile failure is a version mismatch before it is a defect.**
Suite 0.4.0 and later require v0.2 records. Run against a v0.1 record, the profile sentinel
produces a confident failure on a record that is fine. Check the suite and record versions before
believing that result.

**Results are perishable.**
`TR-ENV` validates `iat`, so a record that passes today can fail later with nothing about the
record having changed. A report is a statement about a moment, and it needs its timestamp to be
read correctly.

## Who is asserting what

**Nothing here is independently assessed.**
A report is produced by whoever ran the suite, on evidence they supplied. There is no third-party
assessor and no certification programme behind it. This is why the generated report tells a reader
who does not trust the sender to go and check the record themselves rather than trusting the
summary.
